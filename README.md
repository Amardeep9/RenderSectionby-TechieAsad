# RenderSectionby-TechieAsad


 @RenderSection("footerkeUppar",required:false)---->As we had kept It false we can run our program without using this FooterkeUppar in other file
 
 
 So Basically Render Section is used to occupy some space in ViewPage
 @RenderSection("footerkeUppar", required:true)
So we will get an error if we donâ€™t define section in view page as we had kept it true
Sometimes there is a situation where we have to load our Javascript file before Jquery Libraries, in that this section is used
